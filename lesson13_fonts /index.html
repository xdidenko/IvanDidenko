                          <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS 
                    applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you 
                    use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and 
                    behavior of your UI using React components:<span class="italic">bundles of reusable,

                        <p class="chapter-text">React Native runs on React, a popular open source l
                        ibrary for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it 
                        helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.</p>
                        <p class="chapter-text">We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>

                        <p class="chapter-text-bold">+ components.<span class="normal">The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: 
                            friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</span></p>
                            
                         <p class="chapter-text-bold">+ JSX.<span class="normal">React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that 
                             lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so: </span><span class="highlight">&lt;Text&gt; Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</span></p>

                        <p class="chapter-text">The React docs have <u>a comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you 
                            can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it.
                             Here you are declaring a name for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside <span class="highlight">&lt;Text&gt;</span></p>

                        <p class="chapter-text-bold">+ props.<span class="normal">Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</span></p>

                        <p class="chapter-text-bold">+ state.<span class="normal">While you can think of props as 
                            arguments you use to configure how components render, state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!</span></p>

                              and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.You can learn more about React in the

                        <p class="chapter-text">For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language.
                         In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. 
                         So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
